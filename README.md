# NLP Practicals

This repository contains a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** exercises developed during my Data Science and Machine Learning learning process.  
Each notebook focuses on a specific NLP concept or technique, implemented step-by-step in Python.

---

##  Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and apply the key techniques used in text processing and analysis — from basic preprocessing to vector representations like Word2Vec.  
These notebooks are designed for both learning and experimentation.
